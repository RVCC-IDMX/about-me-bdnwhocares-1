            <!--First Time building a pc-->

            <p>
                I have only ever owned one gaming pc and I bought it prebuit. I upgraded some things like the 
                <ul>
                    <li>Graphics Card</li>
                    <li>Ram</li>
                    <li>Storage</li>
                </ul>

                Now I'm planning on moving everything to a brand new case along with getting new fans and a new cpu cooler. In fact the only things I currently don't plan on replacing is the cpu and motherboard. I'm Mainly doing this because when I first bought the PC, I was scared to touch anything inside of it. Recently I got more comfortable with upgranding things so I decided moving to a new case would give me the general pc bulding experience
